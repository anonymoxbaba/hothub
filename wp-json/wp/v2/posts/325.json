Efficiency of the ASIC chips used to mine bitcoin is expected to increase during the colder months in Alberta, leading to improved performance in Q4 when compared to Q3.<\/p>\n<p>Hut 8\u2019s cost for mining a bitcoin in Q3 2018 was US$3,394, which is below the current market bitcoin price of approximately US$6,500, making Hut 8 amongst the lowest-cost miners of bitcoin in the world. This is reflected in the Company\u2019s quarterly results, as its mining profit for the quarter was $8.8 million with a mining profit margin of 51%.<\/p>\n<p>Hut 8\u2019s mining profit margin and adjusted EBITDA margins were lower during Q3 for two reasons: (i) the price of bitcoin appreciated marginally through the quarter, combined with increased competition from other bitcoin miners (expressed through increased network hash rate); and (ii) to a lesser extent, record setting summer temperatures in Alberta that caused increases in the price of electricity at its Drumheller facility, which facility procures electricity from the Alberta grid. The impact of a hot summer was far less at Hut 8\u2019s larger facility in CMH, which purchases the majority of its electricity under contract with fixed prices.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur Drumheller facility represents approximately 20% of our operations,\u201d said Andrew Kiguel, Chief Executive Officer of Hut 8. \u201cThis summer, a record-setting heat wave in the province resulted in increased electricity costs during certain periods. \u00a0The result was increased electricity costs at the Drumheller site by approximately $0.01 per Kilowatt hour on average. We are actively managing our exposure to market prices through a number of different means. Despite this, Hut 8 achieved record revenue for Q3 and strong overall margins.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A conference call has been scheduled to discuss the Company\u2019s third quarter financial results, hosted by CEO Andrew Kiguel and CFO Jimmy Vaiopoulos, starting at 10:00 a.m. ET today.<\/p>\n<p><b>Date:\u00a0<\/b>Thursday, November 8, 2018<br \/>\n<b>Time:<\/b>\u00a010:00 a.m. ET<br \/>\n<b>Dial-In:\u00a0<\/b>1 (888) 465-5079, Canada 1 (888) 424-8151, US<br \/>\n<b>Passcode:<\/b>\u00a06281 943#<\/p>\n<p>Hut 8 currently operates a total of 73 BlockBox Data Centers, including 56 BlockBoxes at its facility in CMH, Alberta, each BlockBox with 1.2 MW of capacity, representing an aggregate of 67.2 MW of maximum operating power capacity.
