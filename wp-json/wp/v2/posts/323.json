Hut 8 believes it is amongst the lowest cost miners of bitcoin in the world. The Company anticipates the cost per bitcoin to remain competitive, based on the increasing difficulty rate, offset by the facility in the City of Medicine (the \u201cCMH Facility\u201d), which operates more efficient, next generation BlockBoxes.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHut 8 continued to produce a positive mining operating margin and adjusted EBITDA in Q2 2018, despite the price of bitcoin declining by 15% over the quarter and mining difficulty increasing by 69%.\u00a0In our Q3 2018, we will see the positive impact of our CMH Facility, which was completed on July 11, 2018 and represents a 350% increase in our operating capacity resulting in 360 PH\/s increase in output,\u201d said Andrew Kiguel, President and Chief Executive Officer of Hut 8.<\/p>\n<p>Due to the decrease in the price of bitcoin in Q2 2018, Hut 8 incurred a $1.8 million non-cash loss on the re-measurement of the value of bitcoin in inventory, and consequently finished the quarter with a net loss of about $4.9 million. In future quarters, when revenue is recorded, the Company would expect to see unrealized gains or losses based on the price of bitcoin on the corresponding reporting date, relative to the price on the day mined.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are optimistic about the long-term direction of the price of bitcoin. We continue to hold our bitcoin, after paying for expenses,\u201d said Kiguel.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWith 66.7 MW of operating capacity that is fully paid for from proceeds of previous fund raising, Hut 8 is Canada\u2019s largest publicly-traded crypto miner.\u00a0We are currently exploring several new sites in North America that would have aggregate capacity in excess of 300 MW for future developments,\u201d said Kiguel.<\/p>\n<p>A conference call has been scheduled to discuss the Company\u2019s second quarter financial results, hosted by CEO Andrew Kiguel and CFO Jimmy Vaiopoulos, starting at 10:00 a.m. ET.<\/p>\n<p><em>Date<\/em>: Thursday, August 16, 2018<\/p>\n<p><em>Time<\/em>: 10:00 a.m. ET<\/p>\n<p><em>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dial-In<\/em>: 1 (888) 465-5079, Canada 1 (888) 424-8151, US<\/p>\n<p><em>Passcode<\/em>: 7934 356#<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Master Agreement Amendments<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In addition, Hut 8 has made amendments to its Master Services Agreement (\u201c<strong>MSA<\/strong>\u201d) and Master Purchase Agreement (\u201c<strong>MPA<\/strong>\u201d) with Bitfury.<\/p>\n<p>With respect of the MSA, Hut 8 will move from paying Bitfury a monthly service fee of costs plus 10% to paying a $2,500 monthly management fee per BlockBox, plus costs associated with operating the BlockBoxes (with no mark-up).\u00a0Hut 8 management believes this fee schedule will result in a monthly cost reduction and incentivize Bitfury to reduce expenses associated with servicing the BlockBoxes.<\/p>\n<p>With respect of the MPA, amendments were made in two categories:\u00a0(1) confirmation of the ability by Bitfury to deploy its own BlockBoxes for the purposes of self-mining in North America (the \u201c<strong>Self-Mining Right<\/strong>\u201d); and (2) granting Hut 8 an irrevocable and unconditional purchase right with respect to any BlockBoxes deployed by Bitfury in connection with its Self-Mining Right, in each case subject to certain terms and conditions as specified in the amendment to the MPA.\u00a0Hut 8 will also have a purchase right in respect of any Bitfury joint venture interests or self-mining sites. Bitfury will otherwise continue to be subject to its exclusivity arrangements with Hut 8 for the supply and servicing of BlockBoxes in North America. Hut 8 management believe these amendments represent a strategic benefit for Hut 8 as well as its shareholders, including Bitfury. In times when Hut 8 is unable to finance the purchase of additional BlockBoxes, Bitfury will now have the ability to develop and warehouse sites for Hut 8\u2019s benefit.<\/p>\n<p>Amendments to both the MSA and MPA have been approved by the board and will be filed on\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.sedar.com\/\">www.sedar.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p>This earnings release should be read in conjunction with the Company\u2019s Management Discussion &amp; Analysis, Financial Statements and Notes to Financial Statements for Q2 2018, which has been posted under the Company\u2019s profile on SEDAR at\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.sedar.com\/\">www.sedar.com<\/a>\u00a0and are also available on the Company\u2019s website at\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.hut8mining.com\/\">www.hut8mining.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Since beginning its mining operations in December 2017, Hut 8 has mined more than 2,600 bitcoin.<\/p>\n<p><strong><br \/>\nHut 8 Corporate Contact:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Andrew Kiguel<br \/>\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer<br \/>\nTel: (647) 256-1992<br \/>\nE-mail:\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:ak@hut8mining.com\">ak@hut8mining.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Hut 8 Media Contact:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Talk Shop Media<br \/>\nNatalie Davidson<br \/>\nTel: (778) 955-8012<br \/>\nE-mail:\u00a0<u>natalied@talkshopmedia.com<\/u><\/p>\n<p><strong>Hut 8 Investor Contact:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>George Aizpurua<br \/>\nVP, Communications<br \/>\nTel: (416) 742-5600<br \/>\nE-mail:\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:gaizpurua@firstcanadiancapital.com\">gaizpurua@firstcanadiancapital.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>ABOUT HUT 8 MINING CORP.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Hut 8 Mining Corp., headquartered in Toronto, Canada is a cryptocurrency mining and blockchain infrastructure company established through an exclusive arrangement with the Bitfury Group, the world\u2019s leading full-service blockchain technology company.

The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP financial performance measurement. The Company calculates Adjusted EBITDA by adding back to net income (loss): interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, and impairment charges as further adjusted to add back stock-based compensation expense and non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA is provided to investors to supplement the results of operations reported in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in comparing the Company\u2019s financial results with other companies in the industry, many of which also use Adjusted EBITDA in their communications to investors. By excluding non-cash charges such as amortization, depreciation, stock-based compensation and impairment charges, as well as non-operating charges for interest and income taxes, investors can evaluate the Company\u2019s operations and its ability to generate cash flows from operations and can compare its results on a more consistent basis to the results of other companies in the industry. Management also uses Adjusted EBITDA to establish internal budgets and goals, and evaluate performance of its business units and management, and evaluate potential acquisitions. The Company considers Adjusted EBITDA to be an important indicator of the Company\u2019s operational strength and performance of its business and a useful measure of the Company\u2019s historical and prospective operating trends. However, there are significant limitations to the use of Adjusted EBITDA since it excludes interest income and expense and income taxes and non-recurring items such as goodwill impairments, each of which impact the Company\u2019s profitability and operating cash flows, as well as depreciation, amortization, impairment charges and stock-based compensation. The Company believes that these limitations are compensated by clearly identifying the difference between the two measures. Adjusted EBITDA as defined by the Company may not be comparable with similarly named measures provided by other entities.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>*All Figures in Canadian Dollars Unless Otherwise Noted TORONTO, Ontario, August 16, 2018 \u2013\u00a0Hut 8 Mining Corp.\u00a0(TSX-V: HUT) (OTCQX: HUTMF) (\u201cHut 8\u201d, or the \u201cCompany\u201d), one of the world\u2019s largest publicly-traded cryptocurrency mining companies by operating capacity, today announces its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2018 (\u201cQ2 2018\u201d).
