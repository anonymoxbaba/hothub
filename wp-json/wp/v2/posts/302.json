On March 12, 2020, there was one of the largest drops in global capital markets history when the S&amp;P 500 and Dow decreased by nearly 10% in one day, and bitcoin decreased by 37%. The bitcoin price dropped to a low of US$4,107, a level last seen in April of 2019.<\/p>\n<p>For Q1-2020, the Company mined 1,116 bitcoin, resulting in revenue generation of $12.7 million, an increase of 5% from the three months ended March 31, 2019 (\u201cQ1-2019\u201d) with 2,405 bitcoin mined with revenue of $12.1 million. The increasing network difficulty impacted the Company\u2019s production negatively with much fewer bitcoin mined.<\/p>\n<p>Expenses for Q1-2020 were $692k, compared to Q1-2019 of $747k, excluding a reversal gain of non-cash share-based payments of $708k million, compared to Q1-2019 expense of $1.1 million. The reversal is a result of a forfeiture of Restricted Share Units grant by the outgoing CEO.<\/p>\n<p>For Q1-2020, Hut 8 had a revaluation loss of $1.3 million compared to the same period of the prior year gain of $1.0 million. This was from adjusting the value of the digital assets held in inventory to the market value on the reporting date. This loss is from the decrease in bitcoin price from US$7,194 on December 31, 2019 to the March 31, 2020 price of US$6,439. However, by taking advantage of the increasing bitcoin price during the first half of Q1-2020, the Company was able to sell bitcoin for fiat at a higher market price than its adjusted cost base, resulting in a realized gain on use of $0.9 million for Q1-2020, compared to Q1-2019 loss of $0.3 million.<\/p>\n<p>Hut 8 recognized a loss of $0.6 million in Adjusted EBITDA, compared to Q1-2019 loss of $1.3 million. The Adjusted EBITDA losses from Q1-2020 came from the last two weeks of the quarter when the bitcoin price collapsed.<\/p>\n<p>The upcoming bitcoin halving is a major event for bitcoin this year and is also on management\u2019s radar. The halving, set to occur shortly, will have the impact of cutting miners bitcoin compensation per block reward in half. The impact on Hut 8 is difficult to assess. Certainly, without a corresponding increase in the price of bitcoin, Hut 8\u2019s revenue will be impacted negatively. If the price of bitcoin and the network hashrate remain flat, Hut 8\u2019s corresponding revenue would be cut in half subsequent to the halving. Management\u2019s expectation is that there will be a drop in hashrate as less efficient miners shut down, consequently reducing competition. We also anticipate that the price of bitcoin will appreciate post the halving as it has in the past two halvings. However, how these two factors play out is difficult to forecast. Management is actively seeking ways to mitigate these industry specific factors.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Hut 8 announced the appointment of Kyle Appleby as Interim CFO in place of Jimmy Vaiopoulos, who was previously appointed Interim CEO. Subsequent to his appointment as Interim CFO, Appleby was relieved of his duties as Corporate Secretary and replaced by Viktoriya Griffin. Griffin has significant experience as CFO of various public companies in Canada and is a member of the Chartered Professional Accountants of British Columbia.<\/p>\n<p>This release should be read in conjunction with the Company\u2019s unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements and corresponding MD&amp;A for the three months ended March 31, 2020 filed on SEDAR and posted on the Company\u2019s website.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>ABOUT HUT 8 MINING CORP.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Hut 8 is a bitcoin mining company with industrial scale operations in Canada.
