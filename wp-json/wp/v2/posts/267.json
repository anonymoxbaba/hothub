With 109 MW of installed power in\u00a0<span class=\"xn-location\">Alberta<\/span>, and with a third site being stood up in the fourth quarter of 2021, Hut 8 is well positioned to take advantage of favorable Bitcoin mining economics expected to continue into 2022.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><b>New Equity Research Coverage:<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Craig\u2013Hallum Capital Group LLC published their initiating equity research coverage on Hut 8 on\u00a0<span class=\"xn-chron\">August 3, 2021<\/span>.<\/p>\n<h3>About Hut 8:<\/h3>\n<p>Hut 8 is one of\u00a0<span class=\"xn-location\">North America&#8217;s<\/span>\u00a0largest innovation-focused digital asset miners, supporting open and decentralized systems since 2018.
