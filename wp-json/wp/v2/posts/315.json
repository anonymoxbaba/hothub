We reduced our cost of mining to US$2,757 while the price of bitcoin appreciated from US$4,158 at the beginning of the quarter to US$10,817 at the end of the quarter.\u201d said Andrew Kiguel, Chief Executive Officer of Hut 8. \u201cIn addition, management has reduced corporate overhead quarter over quarter. Our cost reduction initiatives put in place during crypto-winter came to fruition during the second quarter to produce exceptional earnings per share of $0.43 for shareholders. In addition, our strategy of retaining bitcoin resulted in a gain of $22.4 million re-measurement of our bitcoin inventory.\u00a0 If Hut 8 had sold its entire bitcoin inventory at the end of Q1-2019, we would not have had the benefit of the appreciation in the price of bitcoin during Q2-2019.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For Q2-2019, fair value gain on re-measurement of digital assets of $22.4 million represented the gain on adjusting the value of the digital assets held in inventory to the market value on the reporting date. This was the biggest gain on re-measurement of digital assets in Hut 8\u2019s history. In future quarters, the Company would expect to see gains or losses based on the price of bitcoin on the reporting date, relative to the price on the day mined, when revenue is recorded.<\/p>\n<p>Hut 8 recognized $17.3 million in Adjusted EBITDA. Net income of $33.7 million or $0.43 per share was recorded for the quarter.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHut 8 remains committed to solely mining bitcoin and retaining an inventory of bitcoin for appreciation.\u00a0\u00a0 Management underwent significant cost saving measures at the end of 2018 to ensure we maintain a lean cost structure. The strategy led to improved margins and the ability to leverage the appreciation in the price of bitcoin. Our operations are stronger than ever, and we are poised for improved financial performance going forward,\u201d said Kiguel.<\/p>\n<p>A conference call has been scheduled to discuss the Company\u2019s second quarter 2019 financial results, hosted by Andrew Kiguel, Chief Executive Officer, and Jimmy Vaiopoulos, Chief Financial Officer with further details below:<\/p>\n<p>Date: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<strong>Monday, August 19, 2019<br \/>\n<\/strong>Time: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<strong>10:00 a.m. ET<br \/>\n<\/strong>Dial-In:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a01 (888) 465-5079, Canada \/ 1\u00a0(888) 424-8151, USA<br \/>\nPasscode:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8540 288#<\/p>\n<p>This earnings release should be read in conjunction with the Company\u2019s Management Discussion &amp; Analysis, Financial Statements and Notes to the Financial Statements for Q2-2019, which has been posted under the Company\u2019s profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and are also available on the Company\u2019s website at www.hut8mining.com.<\/p>\n<p>Since beginning its mining operations in December 2017, Hut 8 has mined over 10,800 bitcoins.
