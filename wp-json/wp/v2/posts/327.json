The cryptocurrency has appreciated approximately 40% since the beginning of the year, outperforming the NASDAQ, the S&amp;P 500, as well as most commodities including gold and oil. Several factors occurring in 2019 give reason for optimism that demand for bitcoin will increase, including:<\/p>\n<p>\u25cf Regulatory clarity for bitcoin sets it apart from other cryptocurrencies<br \/>\n\u25cf Institutional custodial solutions are in the process of being rolled out by traditional players such as Fidelity and Goldman Sachs (via its investment in Bitgo)<br \/>\n\u25cf Increased institutional awareness is rising as major global investment banks now routinely publish updates on bitcoin<br \/>\n\u25cf Inflationary pressure in global fiat currencies is driving increased demand of bitcoin as a storage of wealth<br \/>\n\u25cf Major exchanges are getting involved in bitcoin. For example, the largest stock exchange in the world, the NYSE (via its parent company ICE and partnering with Microsoft and Starbucks), is launching a futures exchange named Bakkt that will settle transactions in physical bitcoin<br \/>\n\u25cf New smartphones are being built with dedicated storage for bitcoin private keys, allowing owners to store and spend bitcoin on their phones<br \/>\n\u25cf Growing optimism for approval from the SEC in 2019 for a bitcoin ETF<br \/>\n\u25cf The rapid growth of the lighting network, a second layer bitcoin application that enables instant use of bitcoin for smaller payments with vendors worldwide. Bitcoin spenders can now use the lightning network to shop at e-commerce sites like Amazon<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHut 8 is optimized to benefit from the evolving strength in bitcoin. Hut 8 does not plan to stray from its strategy of being a pure play bitcoin miner,\u201d said Andrew Kiguel, Chief Executive Officer of Hut 8. \u201cFrom our first day of trading in March 2018 through to March 2019, Hut 8 common shares have had a 95% correlation to the price of bitcoin. This has provided investors with near perfect correlation to the bitcoin price, which was our objective.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>2018 Overview<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Due to the \u201ccrypto winter\u201d, which was marked by a declining price for bitcoin and most cryptocurrencies, 2018 was a challenging year for all cryptocurrency miners. While many miners did not survive, Hut 8 managed its cash and digital assets conservatively to successfully make it through. Today, Hut 8 is stable and poised to benefit from a recovery in the price of bitcoin. The Company will continue to manage operations prudently and with focus.<\/p>\n<p>Although the cryptocurrency markets and bitcoin did not perform to expectations in 2018, Hut 8\u2019s management team did not remain idle. The Company successfully reduced operating costs and positioned Hut 8 as a leading bitcoin miner in North America. The Company\u2019s relationship with Bitfury Holding B.V. (\u201cBitfury\u201d), its strategic partner and largest shareholder remains positive, as does its relationship with the City of Medicine Hat, from whom Hut 8 purchases the majority of its electricity. The Company continues to strive for operational excellence and transparency for its shareholders.<\/p>\n<p>Despite challenges in 2018, it was also a year with tremendous growth for Hut 8. At the beginning of 2018, Hut 8 had seven BlockBoxes ACTM (\u201cBlockBox\u201d) data centers deployed utilizing 8 MW of electricity for 56 Petahash per second (\u201cPH\/s\u201d). At the end of 2018, Hut 8 had 85 BlockBoxes operating that in full operational capacity utilize 95.2 MW of power for 784 PH\/s. This was achieved by the completion of the Company\u2019s flagship site in the City of Medicine Hat, two months ahead of schedule. This facility is a significant achievement and Hut 8 believes that operationally, it is amongst the most cost-effective bitcoin mining sites in the world.<\/p>\n<p>This increase was shown as the Company mined 5,592 bitcoin with revenue generation of $49.4 million compared with 62 bitcoin mined with revenue of $1.1 million in the prior year. To management\u2019s knowledge, Hut 8 remains the world\u2019s largest publicly traded cryptocurrency miner by size of operations. Management has also identified several new potential low-cost sites in North America should the opportunity to expand its operations become available in 2019.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussion of Operations for the 2018 Year<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Hut 8 was not immune to the widespread negative market conditions in 2018 and as a result is recognizing a non-cash write-down on its equipment. In order to more accurately reflect the value of its mining equipment, Hut 8 is taking a non-cash write-down of $85.4 million. Management believes the write-down will value its assets based on the current bitcoin pricing environment, significantly reduce its reported plant and equipment depreciation in its financial results going forward and provide a clearer view of our earnings.<\/p>\n<p>For the 2018 year, fair value loss on re-measurement of digital assets of $17.9 million represented the unrealized loss on adjusting the value of the digital assets held in inventory to the market value on the reporting date. This loss is from the drop in bitcoin price from highs of over US$17,000 in January 2018 to the December 31, 2018 price of US$3,743. In future quarters, the Company would expect to see unrealized gains or losses based on the price of bitcoin on the reporting date, relative to the price on the day mined, when revenue is recorded.<\/p>\n<p>As the price of bitcoin dropped, and most of Hut 8\u2019s costs remained relatively fixed, management sold more bitcoin from its inventory than anticipated to meet its financial obligations. The site operating costs for the year were $24.9 million, which represent the costs incurred related to mining the 5,592 bitcoin for the year ended December 31, 2018. The cost of mining each bitcoin for the year was $4,448 (US$3,423) calculated by dividing site operating costs by the number of bitcoin mined for the 2018 year. The cost of mining remained lower than the average bitcoin price for the 2018 year of $9,839 (US$7,572). Hut 8 finished 2018 with 3,035 bitcoin in its digital asset inventory valued at $15.4 million as of December, 31 2018 based on a bitcoin price of US$3,743.<\/p>\n<p>Expenses for the 2018 year were $8.8 million of which there were non-cash share-based payments of $3.5 million. As discussed, the Company continually manages expenses to grow margins and best position itself for the next bitcoin pricing cycle. This is seen from the decrease in quarterly expenses in Q3-2018 of $2.6 million of which $1.1 million were non-cash to Q4-2018 of $2.1 million of which $1.1 million were non-cash expenses. To combat the declining bitcoin price, management initiated several cost cutting measures that will positively impact 2019 results. These include:<\/p>\n<p>\u25cf In conjunction with its strategic partner, Bitfury, operations in Hut 8\u2019s facilities in Alberta were streamlined via staff reductions in January and April 2019<br \/>\n\u25cf Management renegotiated Hut 8\u2019s management service fee with Bitfury<br \/>\n\u25cf In December 2018, management switched its mining pool to a reduced rate<br \/>\n\u25cf The Company reduced insurance costs<br \/>\n\u25cf Management temporarily froze the use of non-essential operating services<br \/>\n\u25cf Management embarked on an electricity optimization plan in Q2 2018 that management expects to have substantial savings in 2019<\/p>\n<p>In addition, despite a challenging year, Hut 8 is pleased to report positive Adjusted EBITDA of $19.3 million, nearly a 19x increase from the prior year of $1.1 million largely as a result of increased revenue from the new facility at CMH and increased number BlockBoxes in Drumheller.<\/p>\n<p>For 2019, Hut 8 will continue to seek ways to reduce costs and increase mining efficiency. Through management\u2019s cost reductions, Hut 8 is positioned to survive the \u201ccrypto winter\u201d and make it through to the next bitcoin pricing cycle.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThroughout 2018, Hut 8\u2019s average cost per bitcoin was consistently below the market price of bitcoin,\u201d said Andrew Kiguel, Chief Operating Officer of Hut 8. \u201cAs we move into 2019, we are poised to improve margins should the price of bitcoin continues to rise, given our cost cutting initiatives undertaken in late 2018.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Pursuant to the press release of the Company dated March 15, 2019, Hut 8 has issued 22,653 common shares at a deemed price of $1.35 per common share, 37,065 common shares at a deemed price of $0.90 per common, and 39,698 common shares at a deemed price of $1.45 to Induna Energy Inc. in consideration of services provided to the company pursuant to an agreement dated May 29, 2018 and amended February 12, 2019.<\/p>\n<p>Since beginning its mining operations in December 2017, Hut 8 has mined over 9,200 bitcoins. Hut 8\u2019s current capital structure consists of 90,108,118 common shares outstanding, 2,882,222 warrants and 965,000 options. In total, Hut 8 owns and operates two sites in Alberta, Canada utilizing 85 BlockBox AC data centers with current operating capacity of 95.2 MW and 784 PH\/s.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ABOUT HUT 8 MINING CORP.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Hut 8 is a cryptocurrency mining company with industrial scale bitcoin mining operations in Canada.
