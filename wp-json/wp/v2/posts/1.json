(Nasdaq: HUT) (TSX: HUT) (\u201cHut 8\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), one of North America\u2019s largest, innovation-focused digital asset mining pioneers, supporting open and decentralized systems since 2018, is pleased to provide the following corporate update.<\/p>\r\n<p>Today, Hut 8 and Bitfury BV announce their mutual agreement to terminate the historical Investor Rights Agreement (\u201cIRA\u201d) between the two companies. The years of collaboration have enabled a strong partnership for both companies and have led to the advancement of bitcoin mining in Canada. The termination of the IRA will most notably bring to a close Bitfury\u2019s right to a nominee on Hut 8\u2019s Board effective immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to enable time for the Hut 8 Board to transition, Hut 8 has agreed to allow for the delayed resignation of Bitfury\u2019s former nominee Jeremy Sewell, until December 31, 2021.<\/p>\r\n<h3>About Hut 8:<\/h3>\r\n<p>Hut 8 is one of North America\u2019s largest innovation-focused digital asset miners, supporting open and decentralized systems since 2018. Located in energy rich Alberta, Canada, Hut 8 has one of the highest installed capacity rates in the industry and holds more self-mined Bitcoin than any crypto miner or publicly traded company globally. Hut 8 is executing on its commitment to mining and holding Bitcoin and has a diversified business and revenue strategy to grow and protect shareholder value regardless of Bitcoin\u2019s market direction. The Company\u2019s multi-pronged business strategy includes profitable digital asset mining, white-label high-performance compute hosting, as well as yield &amp; income programs leveraging its Bitcoin held in reserve. Having demonstrated rapid growth and a stellar balance sheet, Hut 8 was the first publicly traded miner on the TSX and the first Canadian miner to be listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market. Hut 8\u2019s team of business building technologists are believers in decentralized systems, stewards of powerful industry-leading solutions, and drivers of innovation in digital asset mining and high-performance computing, with a focus on ESG alignment. Through innovation, imagination, and passion, Hut 8 is helping to define the digital asset revolution to create value and positive impacts for its shareholders and generations to come.<\/p>\r\n<h3>Cautionary Note Regarding Forward\u2013Looking Information<\/h3>\r\n<p>This press release includes \u201cforward-looking information\u201d and \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Canadian securities laws and United States securities laws, respectively (collectively, \u201cforward-looking information\u201d).
