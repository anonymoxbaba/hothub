(NASDAQ: HUT) (TSX: HUT) (\u201cHut 8\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), one of North America\u2019s largest, innovation-focused digital asset mining pioneers, supporting open and decentralized systems since 2018, is pleased to provide the following corporate update. All figures are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated.<\/p>\n<p>Hut 8 has executed on a $44.373 million USD purchase of 11,090 MicroBT M30S, M30S+ and M31S miners from SuperAcme Technology (Hong Kong) Limited (\u201cSuperAcme\u201d), representing approximately $44\/Terahash. The miners are expected to be delivered starting in October 2021 and full deployment is anticipated to be complete by December 2021. This purchase complements a smaller purchase of 863 M30S+ and M30S miners made earlier this week that is expected to be delivered and fully deployed in July, 2021.<\/p>\n<p>The anticipated production capacity increase with both purchases upon full deployment is expected to be 1.081 E\/H, which alongside previously announced investments, should bring Hut 8\u2019s total installed capacity to approximately 2.5 E\/H. The new fleet of miners is expected to make up the first operational fleet in the Company\u2019s planned 100 MW facility being developed in partnership with Validus Power.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are excited to have identified this unique opportunity to purchase MicroBT equipment that will enable us to almost double our hashrate before the end of the year and substantially increase the number of Bitcoins earned on a daily basis,\u201d remarked Jaime Leverton, Chief Executive Officer of Hut 8 Mining.<\/p>\n<p>The 2.5 E\/H installed production capacity noted above adds to the 1,600 Gigahash anticipated from the NVIDIA cryptocurrency mining processors. Given current bitcoin network dynamics, these hashrate installations are expected to increase Hut 8\u2019s current average production from 6.5 \u2013 7.5 Bitcoin per day, to 14 \u2013 16 Bitcoin per day based on current economic conditions.<\/p>\n<h3>Bitcoin Network Difficulty Update<\/h3>\n<p>As recently reported, with the exodus of bitcoin network hashrate from China, latest estimates suggest a sharp reduction in network difficulty on July 2, 2021, in the range of 24% to 26%. While early in the transition, it is anticipated that the reduction in network difficulty will increase Hut 8\u2019s current average self-mined production by approximately 2 Bitcoin, from 6.5 \u2013 7.5 Bitcoin per day, to 8.5 \u2013 9.5 Bitcoin per day, without any direct corresponding costs. After giving effect to (i) the announced hash rate expansion above (2.5 E\/H plus 1600 Gigahash, expected to be in place by the end of 2021) and (ii) the anticipated reduction in network difficulty, all else being equal, Hut 8 estimates that its average daily self-mined Bitcoin will increase to 20 \u2013 22 Bitcoin per day.<\/p>\n<h3>About Hut 8:<\/h3>\n<p>Hut 8 is one of North America\u2019s largest innovation-focused digital asset miners, supporting open and decentralized systems since 2018.
