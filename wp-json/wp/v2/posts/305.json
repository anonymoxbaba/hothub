While the global capital markets gradually recovered from its historic drop on March 12, 2020, the cryptocurrency industry prepared for the bitcoin halving that occurred on May 11, 2020. The bitcoin halving reduced the bitcoin reward per block from 12.5 to 6.25 and occurs every four years making bitcoin continually more scarce.<\/p>\n<p>We saw bitcoin recover as it increased from US$6,439 on March 31, 2020 to US$8,602 on the day of the halving, before continuing that momentum to reach US$9,138 on June 30, 2020. The network difficulty decreased subsequent to the halving by 15%, but quickly returned back to levels prior to the halving. This posed a difficult challenge to many bitcoin miners as they saw the bitcoin block reward drop by 50% with similar network difficulty rates meaning that revenue dropped by nearly 50% for all bitcoin miners, including Hut 8.<\/p>\n<p>Hut 8, however, has been anticipating the potential effect of the halving and has worked to keep a very lean and flexible operation to reduce costs when necessary. Site operating costs for Q2-2020 were $8.6 million, a 17% reduction from Q2-2019 of $10.4 million. With Hut 8 taking over the full management of the Medicine Hat site operations, the operating costs are expected to continue to be reduced.<\/p>\n<p>Net finance expense was $0.7 million, a 43% decrease from the same period of the prior year of $1.2 million. Management negotiated a further reduction in the interest rate of its debt from 9.85% to 8% per annum as the bitcoin price stays above US$6,500, bringing the expected future net finance expense per quarter to $0.5 million.<\/p>\n<p>Hut 8\u2019s strategy of mining and holding bitcoin continued to pay off as there was a $9.4 million gain on the re-measurement of bitcoin holdings in Q2-2020. Additionally, by strategically selling bitcoin at peak prices, Hut 8 recorded a $0.7 million gain on use of digital assets. Overall, for Q2-2020, Hut 8 recorded a net income of $2.8 million and a negative Adjusted EBITDA of $86k.<\/p>\n<p>Near the end of the quarter, Hut 8 closed the first prospectus offering by a cryptocurrency mining company in Canada. The capital raise was oversubscribed with the gross proceeds of $8.3 million. The full amount of the net proceeds was committed for a purchase to upgrade the existing mining equipment with the latest technology available in the market. This new equipment is expected to operate at 275 PH\/s with a 12.6 MW of power output. This upgrade is a big step towards modernizing Hut 8\u2019s equipment and increasing the overall efficiency of its bitcoin mining fleet.<\/p>\n<p>This release should be read in conjunction with the Company\u2019s unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements and corresponding MD&amp;A for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 filed on SEDAR and posted on the Company\u2019s website.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>ABOUT HUT 8 MINING CORP.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Hut 8 is a bitcoin mining company with industrial scale operations in Canada.

These non-GAAP measures do not have any standardized meaning and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to supplement the analysis and evaluation of operating performance.<\/p>\n<p>The following terms are used, which are not found in the Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada Handbook and do not have a standardized meaning under GAAP.<\/p>\n<p><em>EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization)<\/em><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cEBITDA\u201d represents net income or loss excluding net finance income or expense, income tax or recovery, depreciation, and amortization.<\/li>\n<li>\u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d represents EBITDA adjusted to exclude share-based compensation, fair value loss or gain on revaluation of digital assets, write-offs, and costs associated with one-time transactions (such as listing fees).<\/li>\n<li>\u201cAdjusted EBITDA Margin\u201d represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>EBITDA is used to show ongoing profitability without the impact of non-cash accounting policies, capital structure, and taxation. This provides a consistent comparable metric for profitability.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMining Profit\u201d represents gross profit (revenue less cost of revenue), excluding depreciation. \u201cMining Profit Margin\u201d represents Mining Profit as a percentage of revenue. Mining Profit and Mining Profit Margin show the cash expenses against the revenue without the impact of non-cash accounting policies such as depreciation.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCost per Bitcoin\u201d represents cost of revenue excluding depreciation, divided by the number of bitcoin mined in the period. This metric is commonly referenced in the bitcoin mining industry and is important to gain an understanding of the profitability in reference to the price of bitcoin.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Certain information in this press release constitutes forward-looking information.
