The reason for the increase was primarily due to Hut 8\u2019s flagship facility in Medicine Hat coming online halfway through 2018 and the purchase of 12 additional BlockBoxes that became operational at the beginning of 2019. The resulting mining profit margin for 2019 was 45% compared to 50% in 2018.<\/p>\n<p>Expenses for the 2019 year were $6.1 million of which there were non-cash share-based payments of $2.9 million. This was compared to the prior year with expenses of $8.8 million of which there were non-cash share-based compensation of $3.5 million. The Company\u2019s focus is to be one of the lowest cost miners in the market to grow bottom line profit and best position itself for the next bitcoin pricing cycle.<\/p>\n<p>Hut 8 recognized $33.5 million in Adjusted EBITDA, an increase of $19.3 million or 73% from the prior year. Hut 8 realized 41% of Adjusted EBITDA Margin in 2019 compared to the prior year of 39%. The increased Adjusted EBITDA Margin allowed the Company to self-finance growth of hashrate, while paying down its debt balance from cash flow generated from operations.<\/p>\n<p>For 2019, Hut 8 had a revaluation gain of $4.3 million (2018 \u2013 loss of $17.9 million) from adjusting the value of the digital assets held in inventory to the market value on the reporting date. This gain is from the increase in bitcoin price from US$3,743 on December 31, 2018 to the December 31, 2019 price of US$7,194. The upward trend of bitcoin price in 2019 also meant that the Company was able to sell bitcoin at a higher market price than its adjusted cost base, resulting in a realized gain on use of $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.<\/p>\n<p>\u201c2019 was a milestone year for Hut 8 as we achieved bottom line profitability which allowed for growth in operating capacity and paying down debt,\u201d said Jimmy Vaiopoulos, Chief Financial Officer of Hut 8. \u201cWe are proud to have had a successful first full year as a public company while also graduating to the TSX via the TSX Sandbox.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The upcoming bitcoin halving is a major event for the industry this year and is also on management\u2019s radar. The halving, set to occur in mid-May 2020, will have the impact of cutting miner\u2019s bitcoin compensation per block reward in half. We expect that will cause many less efficient miners to shut off their miners unless the price of bitcoin significantly appreciates before then. The impact on Hut 8 is difficult to assess. Certainly, without a corresponding increase in the price of bitcoin, Hut 8\u2019s revenue will be impacted negatively. If the price of bitcoin and the network hashrate remain flat, Hut 8\u2019s corresponding revenue would be cut in half subsequent to the halving. Management\u2019s expectation is that there will be a drop in hashrate as less efficient miners shut down, consequently reducing competition. We also anticipate that the price of bitcoin will appreciate post the halving as it has in the past two halving events. However, how these two factors play out is difficult to forecast. Management is actively seeking ways to mitigate these industry specific factors.<\/p>\n<p>Management also continues to monitor the possible impact of the coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) on operations.\u00a0 Management has taken steps to mitigate the impact including setting up remote monitoring of the sites if required. Hut 8 takes COVID-19 seriously and is working with its site operators to keep the sites clean and employees safe.<\/p>\n<p>This release should be read in conjunction with the Company\u2019s audited consolidated financial statements and corresponding MD&amp;A for the year ended December 31, 2019 filed on SEDAR and posted on the Company\u2019s website.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>ABOUT HUT 8 MINING CORP.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Hut 8 is a bitcoin mining company with industrial scale operations in Canada.

This metric is commonly referenced in the bitcoin mining industry and is important to gain an understanding of the profitability in reference to the price of bitcoin.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Certain information in this press release constitutes forward-looking information.
