Hut 8 reports all amounts in Canadian Dollars unless otherwise stated.<\/p>\n<p><strong><br \/>\nQ3-2019 Highlights:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Revenue of $26.7 million; Mining Profit Margin of 58%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $14.7 million.<\/li>\n<li>Mined 1,965 bitcoin at a Cost per Bitcoin of US$4,363 inclusive of electricity costs, mining pool fees, and all other production costs.<\/li>\n<li>Strengthened balance sheet through the reduction of debt by $3.6 million and reduced accounts payable by more than $6 million from the prior quarter.<\/li>\n<li>Increased Retained Bitcoin inventory by 7.6% from the prior quarter to 3,496 bitcoin.<\/li>\n<li>Announced petahash capacity increases of 19.6%.<\/li>\n<li>Approval for trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Selected Annual Financial Information<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2194\" src=\"https:\/\/hut8mining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Screen-Shot-2019-11-06-at-8.00.41-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"586\" height=\"444\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Hut 8 is pleased to report revenue of $26.7 million and a Mining Profit Margin of 58%. The Company faced industry headwinds during the quarter as the bitcoin price dropped by 30% and the network difficulty rate increased by 61%, which both negatively affected Mining Profit Margins.<\/p>\n<p>Utilizing its cash and bitcoin reserves, Hut 8 strengthened its balance sheet by repaying US$2.0 million of its debt to Galaxy Digital Lending in September 2019 and US$2.3 million of its debt to Bitfury for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, including US$750k paid in Q3-2019. In addition, Hut 8 reduced its accounts payable outstanding by over $6.0 million since June 30, 2019. This has led to the increase of Hut 8\u2019s working capital surplus to $5.4 million as at September 30, 2019, which does not include non-current digital assets of $28.6 million. This was a drastic improvement from the working capital deficit as at December 31, 2018 of $18.3 million, which did not include non-current digital assets of $15.4 million.<\/p>\n<p>The fair value loss for Q3-2019 on the revaluation of digital assets of $10.0 million represented the adjustment of value of the digital assets held in inventory to the market value on the reporting date as the price of bitcoin decreased from US$10,817 at the end of Q2-2019 to US$8,293 at the end of Q3-2019. Despite this, the Company recognized a revaluation gain on the fair value of digital assets of $8.2 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.<\/p>\n<p>Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $14.7 million and Adjusted EBITDA margin of 55% for the quarter. Net loss of $1.7 million or a loss per share of $0.02 per share was recorded for the quarter.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHut 8 achieved some significant accomplishments in Q3. We became the first cryptocurrency company to get approved to trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange, which began on October 8, 2019, shortly after the quarter end. In addition, we announced capacity increases of 19.6%, significantly reduced leverage and increased our bitcoin inventory balance.\u201d said Andrew Kiguel, Chief Executive Officer of Hut 8. \u201cHowever, during Q3, the price of bitcoin decreased by 30% and mining difficulty increased by 61%. The impact was a revaluation of our bitcoin balance down by $10.0 million and mining less bitcoin in this quarter versus the previous one.\u201d said Kiguel. \u201cThe overall impact of Q3 is more mining capacity and an improved balance sheet that still retains substantial exposure to bitcoin through our bitcoin inventory.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A conference call has been scheduled to discuss the Company\u2019s third quarter 2019 financial results, hosted by Andrew Kiguel, Chief Executive Officer, and Jimmy Vaiopoulos, Chief Financial Officer with further details below:<\/p>\n<p>Date:\u00a0<strong>Thursday, November 07, 2019<br \/>\n<\/strong>Time:\u00a0<strong>10:00 a.m. ET<br \/>\n<\/strong>Dial-In: 1 (888) 465-5079, Canada \/ 1 (888) 424-8151, USA<br \/>\nPasscode: 5861 331#<\/p>\n<p>This earnings release should be read in conjunction with the Company\u2019s Management Discussion &amp; Analysis, Financial Statements and Notes to the Financial Statements for Q3-2019, which has been posted under the Company\u2019s profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and are also available on the Company\u2019s website at www.hut8mining.com.<\/p>\n<p>Since beginning its mining operations in December 2017, Hut 8 has mined over 12,305 bitcoins.

These non-GAAP measures do not have any standardized meaning and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

This provides a consistent comparable metric for profitability.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMining Profit\u201d represents gross profit (revenue less cost of revenue), excluding depreciation. \u201cMining Profit Margin\u201d represents Mining Profit as a percentage of revenue. Mining Profit and Mining Profit Margin show the cash expenses against the revenue without the impact of non-cash accounting policies such as depreciation.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCost per Bitcoin\u201d represents cost of revenue excluding depreciation, divided by the number of bitcoin mined in the period. This metric is a commonly referenced in the bitcoin mining industry and is important to gain an understanding of the profitability in reference to the price of bitcoin.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRetained Bitcoin\u201d represents the bitcoin mined less the bitcoin used by the Company. This includes the bitcoin held by the Company at period end plus the mined but not received, which is recognized under digital assets receivable.
