Further, we have achieved an important milestone with final delivery of all 10,000 NVIDIA chips. Throughout early weeks of operation, these cutting-edge GPUs have proven to be highly efficient, mining at a total cost of under $3,000 per Bitcoin, delivering margins of approximately 95%.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>HASHRATE UPDATE<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Hut\u202f8\u202fcurrently\u202fhas\u202fan\u202finstalled\u202fhashrate\u202fof\u202fapproximately 1.7\u202fEH\/s, which includes the converted hashrate from our fleet of NVIDIA GPUs.<\/p>\n<p>Our total current and contracted capacity stands at approximately 4.5 EH\/s, which includes the converted hashrate from our fleet of NVIDIA GPUs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>BITCOIN INVENTORY AND VALUE<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As of September 30, 2021, the Company had a total Bitcoin balance of 4,729 with a market value of $263.8 million. Hut 8\u2019s Bitcoin balance as of November 10, 2021, including 2,000 Bitcoin loaned as part of the Company\u2019s fiat yield strategy, is approximately 5,053 Bitcoin, reflecting a market value of approximately $430 million. Hut 8 continues to strategically emphasize its \u201cHODL\u201d strategy, taking active steps to generate Canadian and US dollars to help fund operating expenses, so as to avoid selling Bitcoin.\u00a0 During Q3-2021, 100% of self-mined Bitcoin was deposited into custody.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q3-2021 HIGHLIGHTS<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Third consecutive record quarterly revenue, hitting $50.3 million in Q3-2021, with our self-mining operations generating $47.9 million of revenue and our expanded hosting service generating $2.4 million. We mined 905 Bitcoin in Q3-2021, all of which was added to our self-mined Bitcoin balance.<\/li>\n<li>As of November 10, 2021, the entire fleet of high-performance NVIDIA chips has been received at Hut 8\u2019s site in Medicine Hat, Alberta, and 91% of the servers have been installed and powered up, with full deployment expected in the next week. The addition of the NVIDIA GPUs serves to increase Hut 8&#8217;s aggregate operating rate by approximately 1,600 Gigahash, which based on current network dynamics, equates to an ASIC hashrate of approximately 325 PH\/s. The Company has deployed the NVIDIA GPUs to mine the Ethereum network via Luxor pool, and consistent with our HODL strategy, is receiving payouts in Bitcoin. Based on current mining economics this equates to approximately 1.8 \u2013 2.0 Bitcoin per day, with an average cost to mine each Bitcoin of less than $3,000, making this NVIDIA GPU fleet the most profitable portion of Hut 8\u2019s self-mining operation.<\/li>\n<li>Following its successful listing on The Nasdaq Global Select Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d), the Company benefitted from its access to an increased pool of investors and closed a public offering of common shares on September 17, 2021, raising gross proceeds of $220 million (US$173 million). The Company anticipates the proceeds will be used to support the growth of its business including to fund capital investments in digital asset mining equipment in order to increase mining capacity, for working capital, other general corporate purposes, and potentially for strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or acquisitions.<\/li>\n<li>Based upon the capital flexibility afforded by the Company\u2019s public offering of equity securities in September 2021, Hut 8 executed on a US$58.7 million purchase of 12,000 new MicroBT M30S, M30S+ and M30S++ miners, representing a cost of approximately $50\/Terahash, with aggregate incremental production of 1.17 EH\/s. The miners are expected to be delivered starting in January 2022, at a delivery rate of approximately 1,000 machines per month, with full deployment anticipated by December 2022.<\/li>\n<li>On October 23, 2021, the Company announced that development of its third mining site, in conjunction with Validus Power Corp. (\u201cValidus), was underway in North Bay, Ontario, Canada. This site will begin with 35MW of capacity and expected to be online by the end of December 2021. Power will be available on a physical off-take basis under the Company\u2019s power purchase agreement with Validus, with a power rate of $0.0274\/kWh subject to an annual adjustment mechanism.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>OPERATING AND FINANCIAL OVERVIEW<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-730\" src=\"https:\/\/hut8mining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Revenue-and-Financial-Overview-Image.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"797\" height=\"497\" srcset=\"https:\/\/hut8mining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Revenue-and-Financial-Overview-Image.png 797w, https:\/\/hut8mining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Revenue-and-Financial-Overview-Image-768x479.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 797px) 100vw, 797px\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Revenue for Q3-2021 increased significantly to $50.3 million compared to $5.8 million in the prior year period. Strong mining economics generated $47.9 million of revenue as a result of 905 Bitcoin mined versus $5.3 million of revenue and 372 Bitcoin mined in the prior year period. Our hosting services contributed $2.4 million of revenue compared to $0.5 million in the prior year period, reflecting management\u2019s strategic decision to on-board two hosting customers.<\/li>\n<li>Site operating costs for Q3-2021 totaled $16.0 million versus $7.5 million in the prior year period. The increase reflects power consumption from increased hash rate, and the fact that mining equipment was operating at reduced capacity for much of the third quarter of 2020, in response to compressed self-mining economics.<\/li>\n<li>Net income in Q3-2021 was $23.4 million. The large increase in net income was primarily driven by the revenue generated from the improved performance in our self-mining operations, partially offset by higher costs from the expansion of our business.<\/li>\n<li>Adjusted EBITDA (a \u201cNon-IFRS Measure\u201d, please refer below) in Q3-2021 was $30.7 million, versus an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $2.5 million in the prior year period, driven by the expansion of Hut 8\u2019s operations and the improvement in Bitcoin mining economics.<\/li>\n<li>Digital assets consist of Bitcoin, which had a self-mined balance of 4,729 Bitcoin and a market value of $263.8 million as of September 30, 2021.
