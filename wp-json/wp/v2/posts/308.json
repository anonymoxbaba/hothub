To put this into context, it became 140% more difficult to mine for a bitcoin from just before the halving in May 2020 to September 30, 2020, while the bitcoin price increased by 9% in that same period. The economics of mining bitcoin have significantly improved subsequent to Q3-2020.<\/p>\n<p>Hut 8 also recognized $0.5 million of hosting revenue after signing up its first client with 6MW of latest generation bitcoin mining equipment. This is a new revenue stream for Hut 8 and provides consistent recurring revenue with its available electrical capacity and existing infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p>Hut 8 has continued to find ways to reduce costs in Q3-2020 through many successful initiatives in the quarter. In July 2020, the Company re-negotiated its credit facility terms with Genesis Global Capital, LLC (\u201cGenesis) and successfully reduced the interest rate from 9.85% to 8.00% per annum saving approximately $500,000 per year.<\/p>\n<p>Another initiative during Q3-2020 was that Hut 8 transferred the Clarke chips from its Drumheller facility to Medicine Hat which brought together Hut 8\u2019s higher efficiency chips with its best electricity pricing at Medicine Hat. Also, Hut 8 completed the transfer of the management of operations of both the Medicine Hat and Drumheller facilities from Bitfury to Hut 8, providing for savings of over $1.5 million per year.\u00a0 With full control over the sites, Hut 8 will continue to streamline operations while maintaining the highest industry standards.<\/p>\n<p>Hut 8\u2019s strategy of mining and holding bitcoin continued to pay off as there was a $5.6 million gain on the re-measurement of bitcoin holdings in Q3-2020. Additionally, by only strategically selling bitcoin at higher prices, Hut 8 recorded a $0.2 million gain on the use of digital assets. Overall, for Q3-2020, Hut 8 recorded a net loss of approximately $0.9 million and a negative Adjusted EBITDA of $2.9 million.<\/p>\n<p>More than halfway through the quarter, Hut 8 completed the installation of 1,000 M31S and 1,000 M31S+ mining equipment at its Medicine Hat facility. The equipment collectively increased Hut 8\u2019s mining power by approximately 154 PH\/s using 6.7 MW of power. The remainder of the equipment purchase, which consists of 1,590 M30S units is expected to be shipped late November 2020 and will provide an additional 140 PH\/s using approximately 5.3MW.<\/p>\n<p>Hut 8 also achieved a milestone when they became the first company to successfully exit the TSX Sandbox which solidifies Hut 8 as a TSX listed issuer. Hut 8 was also the first issuer to be listed to the TSX via the TSX Sandbox and has been trading on the senior TSX exchange since early October 2019.<\/p>\n<p>This release should be read in conjunction with the Company\u2019s unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements and corresponding MD&amp;A for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 filed on SEDAR and posted on the Company\u2019s website.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ABOUT HUT 8 MINING CORP.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Hut 8 is a bitcoin mining company with industrial scale operations in Canada.
