In addition, record cold weather in Alberta resulted in higher electricity pricing.\u201d said Andrew Kiguel, Chief Executive Officer of Hut 8. \u201cIn March and continuing into the second quarter, we have experienced lower electricity prices and a much improved bitcoin price. This has significantly improved our margins in the second quarter thus far.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Alberta had a record cold winter, which led to higher electricity prices at our operations that are not under a power contract. Despite having higher than normal electricity prices in January and February, Hut 8\u2019s cost per bitcoin decreased slightly from US$3,995 in Q4-2018 to US$3,950 in Q1-2019. The impact of management\u2019s cost reduction initiatives and electricity optimization in Q1-2019 were successful in offsetting the higher energy prices. In addition, Hut 8\u2019s management was successful in reducing corporate overhead excluding non-cash share-based compensation from $994k in Q4-2018 to $747k in Q1-2019.<\/p>\n<p>For Q1-2019, fair value gain on re-measurement of digital assets of $789,678 represented the gain on adjusting the value of the digital assets held in inventory to the market value on the reporting date. This was the first gain on re-measurement of digital assets in Hut 8\u2019s history and marks a turn in the bitcoin prices. In future quarters, the Company would expect to see gains or losses based on the price of bitcoin on the reporting date, relative to the price on the day mined, when revenue is recorded.<\/p>\n<p>Hut 8 recognized negative $1.3 million in Adjusted EBITDA, the first quarter of negative Adjusted EBITDA operations for the Company. A net loss was recorded for the quarter was $6,065,495. Both losses were largely as a result of bitcoin prices remaining at approximately a 52-week lows during Q1-2019, hash rates increasing, and volatile natural gas prices which all negatively impacted operations for the quarter.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHut 8 remains committed to solely mining bitcoin and to retain as much as possible. Despite harsh operating conditions, Hut 8 retained 2,615 bitcoin at the end of Q1-2019. Management underwent significant cost saving measures at the end of 2018 to ensure we maintain a lean cost structure and are in a position to capitalize on the recent upswing. Our operations are stronger than ever, and we are poised for improved financial performance going forward given the recent appreciation in the price of bitcoin that began in April 2019,\u201d said Kiguel.<\/p>\n<p>A conference call has been scheduled to discuss the Company\u2019s first quarter 2019 financial results, hosted by Andrew Kiguel, Chief Executive Officer, and Jimmy Vaiopoulos, Chief Financial Officer with further details below:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Date:<\/strong>\u00a0Wednesday, May 29, 2019<br \/>\n<strong>Time:<\/strong>\u00a010:00 a.m. ET<br \/>\n<strong>Dial-In:<\/strong>\u00a01 (888) 465-5079, Canada<br \/>\n1 (888) 424-8151, USA<br \/>\n<strong>Passcode:<\/strong>\u00a05498 622#<\/p>\n<p>This earnings release should be read in conjunction with the Company\u2019s Management Discussion &amp; Analysis, Financial Statements and Notes to the Financial Statements for Q1-2019, which has been posted under the Company\u2019s profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and are also available on the Company\u2019s website at www.hut8mining.com.<\/p>\n<p>Since beginning its mining operations in December 2017, Hut 8 has mined over 9,950 bitcoins.
