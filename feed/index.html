<ul>
<li>345 Bitcoin were mined, resulting in an average production rate of 11.1 Bitcoin per day</li>

<ul>
<li>We installed 560 new MicroBT M30S and M31S+ miners</li>

All dollar figures are in Canadian Dollars (&#8220;CAD&#8221;), unless otherwise stated.</p>
<p>&#8220;2021 was truly a transformational year at Hut 8, complemented by considerable growth,&#8221; said <span class="xn-person">Jaime Leverton</span>, CEO of Hut 8. &#8220;In pursuing a diversified strategy, we have differentiated ourselves from our peer group and in doing so, have become the only company in <span class="xn-location">North America</span> to both mine digital assets while building on our traditional infrastructure business to support companies in Web 3.0 and the Metaverse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Achieving sizable improvement across key financial and operating metrics in fiscal 2021, we delivered record breaking results for our shareholders,&#8221; said <span class="xn-person">Shane Downey</span>, CFO of Hut 8. &#8220;We continue to have one of the largest self-mined Bitcoin reserves in the world, currently holding more than 6,200 Bitcoin, and look forward to driving operating efficiencies at our mining sites by deploying next-generation miners.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>2021 HIGHLIGHTS</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Record-breaking revenue of <span class="xn-money">$173.8 million</span> during the year ended <span class="xn-chron">December 31, 2021</span>, with our self-mining operations generating <span class="xn-money">$165.4 million</span> of revenue and our expanded hosting service generating <span class="xn-money">$8.4 million</span>. We mined 2,786 Bitcoin in 2021.<br class="dnr" /><br class="dnr" /></li>
<li>The Company was the first Canadian digital asset miner to list its common shares on the Nasdaq stock exchange (&#8220;Nasdaq&#8221;), on <span class="xn-chron">June 15, 2021</span>.<br class="dnr" /><br class="dnr" /></li>
<li>On <span class="xn-chron">December 3, 2021</span>, Hut 8 was the first in its industry to be added to the S&amp;P TSX index.<br class="dnr" /><br class="dnr" /></li>
<li>The Company purchased an aggregate of 31,912 MicroBT Whatsminers throughout 2021, including M30S, M30S+, M30S++, and M31S+ miners. We expect that the approximately 10,000 miners not yet received will be shipped in regular intervals throughout 2022.<br class="dnr" /><br class="dnr" /></li>
<li>On <span class="xn-chron">December 30, 2021</span>, the Company entered into a <span class="xn-money">$38.3 million</span> (<span class="xn-money">US$30 million</span>) senior secured equipment financing term loan with Trinity Capital Inc (&#8220;Trinity&#8221;). The equipment financing provides the Company with non-dilutive growth capital and was structured such that collateral support is limited to certain new MicroBT machines being installed at the Company&#8217;s <span class="xn-location">Medicine Hat, Alberta</span> and <span class="xn-location">North Bay, Ontario</span> sites.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>HASHRATE UPDATE</b></p>
<p>On <span class="xn-chron">December 31, 2021</span>, Hut 8 had an installed hashrate of approximately 2.0 EH/s, which includes the converted hashrate from our fleet of NVIDIA GPUs. The hashrate increased to 2.5 EH/s by <span class="xn-chron">February 28, 2022</span>.</p>
<p>The Company&#8217;s current capacity stands at approximately 3.55 EH/s once all the ordered miners are received and deployed, which includes the converted hashrate from our fleet of NVIDIA GPUs.</p>
<p><b>BITCOIN INVENTORY AND VALUE</b></p>
<p>As of <span class="xn-chron">December 31, 2021</span>, the Company had a total Bitcoin balance of 5,518 with a market value of <span class="xn-money">$323.9 million</span>, including 2,000 Bitcoin loaned as part of the Company&#8217;s fiat yield strategy. Hut 8 continues to strategically emphasize its &#8220;HODL&#8221; strategy, taking active steps to generate Canadian and US dollars to help fund operating expenses, while avoiding selling Bitcoin. During Q4-2021, 100% of self-mined Bitcoin was deposited into custody.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Revenue for the year-ended <span class="xn-chron">December 31, 2021</span> was <span class="xn-money">$173.8 million</span> compared to <span class="xn-money">$40.7 million</span> in the prior year. The 327% increase was primarily driven by the Company&#8217;s digital asset mining operations, where the Company mined 2,786 Bitcoin and generated <span class="xn-money">$165.4 million</span> of revenue, versus 2,798 Bitcoin mined and <span class="xn-money">$39.0 million</span> of revenue in the prior year. The Company maintained its Bitcoin mining capacity despite the significant year-over-year increase in Bitcoin network difficulty, by deploying additional higher efficiency miners during 2021 compared to 2020. Bitcoin price appreciation resulted in average revenue per Bitcoin mined of <span class="xn-money">$59,367</span> for 2021 compared to average revenue per Bitcoin mined of <span class="xn-money">$13,925</span> in 2020. The Company&#8217;s hosting services contributed <span class="xn-money">$8.4 million</span> of revenue during the year compared to <span class="xn-money">$1.7 million</span> in the prior year.<br class="dnr" /><br class="dnr" /></li>
<li>Cost of revenue consists of site operating costs and depreciation and was <span class="xn-money">$85.0 million</span> for the year ended <span class="xn-chron">December 31, 2021</span>, compared to <span class="xn-money">$59.2 million</span> in the period year. The average site operating costs of mining each Bitcoin for 2021 was approximately <span class="xn-money">$22,100</span>, compared to approximately <span class="xn-money">$13,600</span> in the prior year period, with the increase due primarily to the <span class="xn-chron">May 2020</span> &#8220;halving&#8221; event, as well as increased network difficulty in the second half of 2021. Depreciation expense increased to <span class="xn-money">$23.3 million</span> during 2021 compared to <span class="xn-money">$21.3 million</span> in 2020, driven by the increased number of miners deployed during the year, partially offset by the extension of estimated useful life of infrastructure assets from 4 years to 10 years.<br class="dnr" /><br class="dnr" /></li>
<li>Net loss was <span class="xn-money">$72.7 million</span> for the year ended <span class="xn-chron">December 31, 2021</span>, compared to net income of <span class="xn-money">$19.0 million</span> for the same period in 2020. The change is primarily due to non-cash revaluation loss on liability warrants of <span class="xn-money">$114.2 million</span> partially offset by increased revenue.<br class="dnr" /><br class="dnr" /></li>
<li>Adjusted EBITDA (a non-IFRS measure) increased by <span class="xn-money">$96.8 million</span> for the year ended <span class="xn-chron">December 31, 2021</span>, compared to the same period in 2020. The increase was driven by higher digital asset mining profit, partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses incurred to support the growth in the Company&#8217;s operations.<br class="dnr" /><br class="dnr" /></li>
<li>Digital assets consist of Bitcoin, which had a balance of 5,518 Bitcoin and a market value of <span class="xn-money">$323.9 million</span> as of <span class="xn-chron">December 31, 2021</span>. This balance consisted of 3,518 Bitcoin held in custody and 2,000 held under lending arrangements.<br class="dnr" /><br class="dnr" /></li>
<li>A search for a General Counsel and Corporate Secretary is underway after <span class="xn-person">Tanya Woods</span> left the company in <span class="xn-chron">March 2022</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>NON-IFRS MEASURES</b></p>
<p>This MD&amp;A makes reference to certain measures that are not recognized under IFRS and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS. They are therefore not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The Company uses non-IFRS measures including &#8220;Adjusted EBITDA&#8221; and &#8220;Mining Profit&#8221; as additional information to complement IFRS measures by providing further understanding of the Company&#8217;s results of operations from Management&#8217;s perspective.</p>
<p>The following tables reconcile non-IFRS measures used by the Company to analyze the operational performance of Hut 8, to their nearest IFRS measure and should be read in conjunction with the audited annual consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) and audited annual consolidated statement of cash flows included in the audited annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended <span class="xn-chron">December 31, 2021</span>.</p>
<p><b><i>Mining Profit</i></b></p>
<p><i>&#8220;Mining profit&#8221;</i> represents gross profit (revenue less cost of revenue), excluding depreciation and revenue and site operating costs directly attributable to hosting services. Mining profit shows profitability of the Company&#8217;s core digital asset mining operation, without the impact of non-cash depreciation expense.</p>

</i></b></div>
<div></div>
<div class="table-responsive"><b><i>Adjusted EBITDA</i></b></div>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>&#8220;Adjusted EBITDA&#8221;</i> represents EBITDA (net income or loss excluding net finance income or expense, income tax or recovery, depreciation, and amortization) adjusted to exclude non-cash share-based compensation, fair value gain or loss on revaluation of digital assets, non-recurring impairment charges or reversals of impairment, and costs associated with one-time or non-recurring transactions. Adjusted EBITDA is used to assess profitability without the impact of non-cash accounting policies, capital structure, taxation, and one-time or non-recurring transactions. This performance measure provides a consistent comparable metric for profitability of the Company across time periods.</p>

LOS ANGELES/TORONTO, March 2, 2022 — Enthusiast Gaming Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: EGLX; TSX: EGLX),<br />

Hut 8 Mining Corp. (NASDAQ: HUT; TSX: HUT) (“Hut 8”), one of North America’s largest innovation-focused digital<br />
asset mining pioneers, supporting open and decentralized systems since 2018. The partnership marks the first time<br />
Hut 8 has come together with a gaming and esports organization, and Enthusiast Gaming’s first partnership with a<br />
digital asset miner.</p>
<p>As ambitious leaders at the intersection of gaming and digital asset mining, Enthusiast Gaming and Hut 8 will<br />
collaborate on new experiences and content within mobile and blockchain gaming, Web 3.0, NFTs, and cryptocurrency.<br />
Gaming, specifically blockchain gaming, is forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 14.5% through 2026,<br />
now that gamers are capable of and interested in owning their own digital assets.</p>
<p>To kick off the partnership, Enthusiast Gaming will release a significant update to its first-person shooter game EV.IO,<br />
featuring Hut 8 as a presenting sponsor. Hut 8 will also become a sponsor of Luminosity Gaming, the top esports<br />

and experiences. Hut 8 is also positioned to provide critical infrastructure support by hosting Enthusiast Gaming in its<br />
data centres, which are connected to electrical grids powered by significant renewables and emissions-free resources.</p>
<p>“As we consider new opportunities in Web 3.0, the Metaverse, NFTs and cryptocurrency, we’re proud to join a<br />
partnership that will really deliver for our creators, communities and fans, and to kick things off with Hut 8 by bringing<br />
our flywheel of opportunities to them, through our latest launch from Addicting Games, and as a partner on Luminosity<br />
Gaming,” said Adrian Montgomery, CEO of Enthusiast Gaming. “With one of the highest inventories of self-mined<br />
Bitcoin of any publicly-traded company globally, Hut 8 has established itself as an innovative leader by bridging digital<br />
asset mining with the traditional data centre industry, and is now serving both traditional high-performance applications<br />
and applications in the gaming and blockchain space.”</p>
<p>“As a digital currency miner with data centre infrastructure, we’re ideally positioned to join forces with one of North<br />
America’s largest and fastest growing gaming entertainment companies and generate the unique benefits of this<br />
strategic partnership,” said Jaime Leverton, CEO of Hut 8. “We’re excited to host Enthusiast Gaming in our data<br />
centres and collaborate on new experiences and content that will connect us to their audience of 300 million Gen Z and<br />
Millennial viewers, the majority of whom are crypto-savvy.”</p>

<p><strong>Mining Production Highlights for January 2022:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>308 Bitcoin were mined, resulting in an average production rate of 9.93 Bitcoin per day;
<ul>
<li>Approximately 16% of Bitcoin production was from the Company&#8217;s fleet of GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) miners, being used to mine Ethereum, while receiving payouts in Bitcoin.The efficient nature of these GPUs, with minimal power requirements, resulted in an average cost of less than C$2,600 per Bitcoin;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>100% of the self-mined Bitcoin for the month of January were deposited into custody, consistent with Hut 8’s Hodl strategy;</li>
<li>Total Bitcoin balance held in reserve is 5,826 as of January 31, 2022;</li>
<li>Installed operating capacity currently sits at 2.36 EH/s, a 17% increase from December 31, 2021.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Operations Updates for January 2022:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>During January 2022, the Company installed 6,317 MicroBT M30S and M31S+ miners, while retiring the older fleet of Bitfury Clarkes.</li>
<li>Hut 8 has also advanced with respect to construction and development of the Company’s third data centre located in North Bay, Ontario. The building structure is complete, floors are being poured imminently and racking is expected to commence later in February 2022.</li>
</ul>
<p>“Our team is working hard deploying additional miners between our two Alberta-based sites, increasing overall efficiency and hashrate using existing capacity ” said Jason Zaluski, Head of Technology for Hut 8. “Our goal is to always utilize the most efficient miners we have, and we have been receiving and fully deploying our MicroBT units as they arrive, which speaks to the commitment and capability of our team on the ground, here in Alberta.”</p>
<p><strong>About the Company:</strong></p>
<p>Hut 8 is one of North America’s largest innovation-focused digital asset miners, led by a team of business building technologists, bullish on bitcoin, blockchain, web 3.0 and bridging the nascent and traditional high performance computing worlds. With two digital asset mining sites located in energy rich Alberta and a third site in North Bay, Ontario Canada, Hut 8 has one of the highest installed capacity rates in the industry and holds more self-mined Bitcoin than any crypto miner or publicly traded company globally. The Company’s acquisiiton of the cloud and colocation data center business from TeraGo Inc, establishes Hut 8 as a leading high-performance computing platform, providing unique positioning for the Company within the digital asset ecosystem. The data center business spans from Toronto to Vancouver with over 36,000 square feet of geo-diverse data center space powered by predominantly emmission-free energy sources. With this acquisition, Hut 8 is bridging traditional and nascent forms of high-performance compute, taking an unconventional approach to revolutionizing conventional assets, creating the first hybrid data center model that serves both the traditional high performance compute (web 2.0) and nascent digital asset computing sectors and web 3.0. Hut 8 has established a Tier 0 to Tier 3 computing platform and allocated digital asset mining and open-source distributed ledger technology to conventionally underutilized areas in a conventional high performance compute data center. The platform consists of approximately 400 commercial customers, across a variety of industry verticals including gaming, visual effects and government agencies, and a platform for the development of applications and services to underserved markets and customers in the growing digital asset, blockchain, gaming and web 3.0 industries. We envision a future of robust infrastructure offering to provide economies of scale, and economies of scope in the high-performance computing and the growing application development in web 3.0 and the digital asset ecosystem. Hut 8’s team of business building technologists are believers in decentralized systems, stewards of powerful industry-leading solutions, and drivers of innovation in digital asset mining and high-performance computing, with a focus on ESG alignment.
